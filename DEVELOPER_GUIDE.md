```

### 2. **Take Assessments**
```
1. Click "Take Assessment" on Kolb's Learning Cycle
2. Answer all questions (drag sliders or select options)
3. Submit assessment
4. Repeat for Sternberg's Intelligence
5. Repeat for Dual Process Theory
6. After completing all 3, you'll see "Generate My Report" button

## 🐛 What Was Fixed

### Critical Bugs Resolved:
1. ✅ **PostgreSQL ID Migration**
   - Changed all `_id: string` to `id: number`
   - Fixed in: DashboardPage, ReportPage, AdminPage
   - Impact: "View Full Report" now works

2. ✅ **Login Redirect Issue**
   - Changed from React Router `navigate()` to `window.location.href`
   - Impact: Login/Register now properly redirects to dashboard

3. ✅ **CORS Configuration**
   - Added Vercel domain to whitelist
   - Impact: Frontend can communicate with backend

4. ✅ **Environment Variables**
   - Set in Vercel dashboard (not just .env file)
   - Impact: API calls go to correct backend URL

5. ✅ **TypeScript Build on Render**
   - Moved @types/* to dependencies
   - Impact: Backend builds successfully on Render

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Render Free Tier
- Backend sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds (cold start)
- **Solution**: Just wait for the backend to wake up

- Users can register with any email
- No email confirmation required
- **Future Enhancement**: Add email verification

### No Password Reset
- Users cannot reset forgotten passwords
- **Future Enhancement**: Add forgot password flow

## 💡 Tips for Development

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend
npm install
docker-compose up -d  # Start PostgreSQL
npm run dev          # Start backend on port 5001

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start            # Start frontend on port 3000
```

### Checking Logs
```bash
# Backend logs (Render)
Go to: Render Dashboard → Service → Logs

# Frontend logs (Vercel)
Go to: Vercel Dashboard → Deployment → Build Logs

# Local backend logs
Just check the terminal running `npm run dev`

# Database logs (Docker)
docker logs thinking_styles_postgres
```

### Database Access (Local)
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker exec -it thinking_styles_postgres psql -U postgres -d thinking_styles

# Common queries
\dt                    # List tables
\d users              # Describe users table
SELECT * FROM users;  # View all users
```
